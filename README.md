Exploratory Data Analysis in R: The primary objective of the analysis is to gather information about salaries in the USA and determine the various factors influencing them.
The dataset, "Salary," is obtained from kaggle.com.

The analysis is divided into two parts. In the first part, I focus on the dataset and examine each variable separately. In the second part, I aim to identify connections between different factors and address hypothetical questions about dependencies.
